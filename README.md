### Hyprland configuration autoinstall

This is a script that I am keeping to rice Linux the way I like [*hyprland*](https://hypr.land/) (appearance, tools, dotfiles and more) so that I can configure it quickly in any PC by cloning this repository and executing the `install-hyprland.sh` script.

##### To do list
- add and configure power button
- configure hyprlock to show more informations like time, date and text
- check if screen sharing is really working
